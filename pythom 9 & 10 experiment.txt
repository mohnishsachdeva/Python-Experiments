1. Display lines starting with a specific keyword
keyword = "Error"
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        if line.startswith(keyword):
            print(line.strip())


2. Print file content in reverse order
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    for line in reversed(lines):
        print(line.strip())


4. Search for a specific word in a file and display lines containing it
search_word = "network"
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        if search_word in line:
            print(line.strip())


5. Count occurrences of a specific word in a file
word_to_count = "data"
count = 0

with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        count += line.lower().count(word_to_count.lower())

print(f"Occurrences of '{word_to_count}':", count)


6. Find the longest word in a file
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    words = file.read().split()
    longest_word = max(words, key=len)
    print("Longest word:", longest_word)
